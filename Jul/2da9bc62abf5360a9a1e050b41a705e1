'Obsessed' man claims he has spent R507,000 on a scanner that shows where the missing girl is A South African man claims to have found the burial site of Madeleine McCann, a British child who went missing five years ago, Sky News reported on Friday. Stephen Birch said he took radar scans last week in Praia da Luz, the Portuguese holiday resort where three-year-old Madeleine disappeared, according to a report on news.sky.com. He had given the scans to Scotland Yard detectives and Portuguese police. “I’ve had the scans analysed and they show digging, a void and what could be human bones,” he told Sky News. Birch is reportedly a commercial property developer in South Africa, and is obsessed with the Madeleine McCann case. He claimed he spent UK40,000 (R507,100) on the scanner and being trained to use it.
