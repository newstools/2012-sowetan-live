ROME - Atalanta's Andrea Masiello has been arrested in a new probe into match-fixing in Italian football. Prosecutors in Bari had ordered an investigation into match-fixing involving the city's club following new evidence that players were paid bribes to help determine the outcome of various matches. Masiello, a defender, was arrested at his home in Bergamo and taken to Bari for questioning. He later admitted under questioning to have scored an own goal in a 2-0 defeat to Lecce in return for ÃŸ50000 (R515000). He spent three years at Bari before joining Atalanta last summer. Two other men, Giovanni Carella and Fabio Giacobbe, who were friends of Masiello and placed bets, were also arrested. Prosecutors are looking into five Bari matches from the past two seasons and are investigating nine ex-Bari players, including Masiello. In total 20 people are being investigated. As well as Masiello, Daniele Portanova, Alessandro Parisi, Simone Bentivolgio, Marco Rossi, Abdelkader Ghezzal, who now plays in Spain with Levante, Marco Esposito, Antonio Bellavista and Nicola Belmonte are under investigation. One of the main matches under investigation is the one against Lecce which Masiello helped fix. "For Bari v Lecce on May 15 2011, we've ascertained that guarantees were made and then exchanged for money," said Bari prosecutor Antonio Laudati. Lecce won that match 2-0, ensuring they avoided relegation. Other matches under investigation are a 3-0 win over Genoa and a 3-3 draw at Udinese in May 2010, as well as a 1-0 defeat to Cesena on April 17 last year and a 4-0 win at Bologna.
