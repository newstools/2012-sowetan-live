A mudslide killed six people and injured up to 20 others Monday in the south-eastern Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro. Civil protection officials said they feared the number of dead might rise. After days of heavy rain in the area, the mudslide in the town of Sapucaia, about 150 kilometres north-east of Rio de Janeiro, partially or totally buried eight homes. Among the missing is a family who were caught by the mud as they tried to flee the area in their car. Persistent rain is making rescue efforts difficult. Since the beginning of the year, around 30,000 people have left their homes in the state of Rio and in the neighbouring state of Minas Gerais to escape floods and mudslides. In January 2011, more than 900 people died in a rain-related disaster in the mountainous region of the state of Rio.Author: Helmut Reuter
